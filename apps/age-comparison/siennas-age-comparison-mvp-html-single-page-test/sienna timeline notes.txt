wan app that stores my daughter's favorate youtubers, bands, etc (i have a csv if you want it!) with their birthdays, heights, name of their channel, sorts them by different categories, etc but the main purpose is that the is always asking us how old this or that person is now. How old were they when they started their youtube channel, how old was she when she started watching them(Spy Ninjas on YT for instance) if /listening to (a band, ie: KidzBop), how old when was at that concert or Shrek Musical, etc. we can't keep track! so if we start with a small csv and can add people and events to it, she can change the date (a slider or calendar picker etc) and see the ages of the person, persons, etc (she often wants to know how old mommy and daddy were also at the time of the event she is asking about) and compare ages. Compare heights. etc. She also wants to know who's mommy's favorite character in a show was, or in XOMGpop band, etc. She's 14, has cerebral palsy and hand movement is a little challenging, so we need an easy UI and a fairly simple UX.
