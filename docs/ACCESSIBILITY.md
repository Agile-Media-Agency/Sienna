# Accessibility Guidelines

- High contrast themes and large touch targets by default.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; animations must be optional.
- Always include labels, roles, keyboard navigation, and focus outlines.
- Provide captions and TTS where helpful; keep sound/vibration configurable.
- Use plain, literal language; avoid idioms and ambiguous phrasing.
- Test on mobile and tablet; ensure one-handed operation works well.
