# UI Style & Tech Choices

- Base CSS: Pico.css (lightweight, semantic defaults)
- Animations: Motion.dev (opt-in; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Avoid for now: Tailwind, Shadcn/ui (overkill for current scope)
- Goals: high contrast, large touch targets, readable typography, minimal cognitive load
